# RP Tech Evaluation

## Submission
Commit the work product for each question individually on a single "feature" branch.
Create a pull request in to the upstream repository when complete, then rebase your branch onto the `rebase` branch

### Exercises
1. In `filter_strings.py`, modify the `filter_strings()` function to return a collection of unique strings with the prefix `TRG_`

1. Make `filter_strings.py` world-executable, if not using a linux system, commit a text file containing the necessary command

1. Modify the configuration in `terraform_module/main.tf`for conciseness
     * Apply the configuration
     * Ensure that all files generated when applying the terraform configuration are not committed to this repo 

1. Create a script in any language that outputs a line-delimited file of service names from `docker-compose-template.yaml`

1. Build, run, and make a successful HTTP GET request to the dockerized application in `dockerized_application/`
    * If there are any runtime errors, troubleshoot and fix.
